Hello, I am a senior studying CS. My favorite programming languages are JavaScript and Python. JavaScript dominates web development so much that even if you hate JavaScript, you're forced to love it. I like Python because it's super easy to "write what you think." If I have a thought, I can translate it to Python without skipping a beat.
