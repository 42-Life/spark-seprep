Hi, my name is Oluwaseun Ademiloye. My favorite programming language is Python. I may be biased since it was the first programming language I learned, but it is also very simple and has many applications. I think it is a great beginner language to start with and there are so many fun libraries within it (matplotlib and turtle are my favorites).
