# AN NGO 

Hello my name is An (Sue) Ngo. My favorite coding language is assembly. Since it's such a low level language, it's very easy for me to follow the code and see what it's doing. I also like the challenge of assembly––writing over 8 likes for one loop haha. I like working with low level languages since I am interested in embedded systems, computer systems, etc.
