#Student Introduction
## Name: Truc Duong

Helloooo! My name is Truc Duong. I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science at BU. I love solving problems and building solutions that are practical. I have experience with multiple programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C and C++. However, my favorite programming language is Python because it is easy to use. Writing code in python resembles writing pseudocode in English.
