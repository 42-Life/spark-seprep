Hi, my name is Aakanksha Duggal. 
My favorite programming language is python because it lets me play around with data. It provides a comprehensive toolkit that empowers you to explore, analyze, and derive meaningful insights from datasets, making it an excellent choice for anyone passionate about working with data.
