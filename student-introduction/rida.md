# Rida Naeem

Hi, my name is Rida Naeem. I am senior studying Neuroscience and CS.
My favorite programming language is MATLAB because I have learned in my neuroscience classes how to model neural simulations in it and I really enjoy computational neuroscience and how much can be done to better understand biology through math and modeling.
