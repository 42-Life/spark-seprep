Sean Lin

Hi, my name is Sean Lin. My favorite programming language is Python because the syntax is easy and type 
declarations are not needed unlike in Java. At the same time I like Java, because we include the types for the
variables making it easier to understand and there is more error checking in Java. In my free time, I like 
to watch and play tennis.
