Some challenges when working alongside:
-	Forgot to cd into whisper-self-hosted-llm/whisper-model-service
-	Initially downloaded ggml-small.bin, however canâ€™t find 
/local/path/to/self-hosted-llms/models/ggml-small.bin: no such file or directory
-	Do not know that I have to make 2 separate pages in command after connecting
-	When first time connecting, it automatically connects me to port 8501
-	After connecting into 8001, it shows the Json error
-	Trying to annotate the python script in github, but failed
