downloading streamlit, model may require virtual machine on my macbook air m1 machine, I waste a lot of time on solving it.
1 to install streamlit, "pip install streamlit" should work, but for me, I need to firstly use "venv" virtual machine to run "pip install streamlit"
2 when download and deploy model to local folder, just need to ensure the path in terminal is 100% correct, then there should be no issue on that.
3 If there is permission error or inconpatible dependency, google it. Don't use "sudo" unless really understand the commands. 

The only challenge is how familiar I'm to my machine so I won't stuck on environment installation or other triky stupid bugs.
An efficient way to solve bugs is read terminal output error carefully and google it if you haven't seen it. A big project consists of multiple small parts, 
we only consider each small part at a time, so bugs from them are easy to solve.
